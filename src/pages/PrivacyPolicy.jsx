                                change in Trackon’s business model is being
                                planned and implemented.

                                PIAs are meant to describe and document what
                                personal information will be involved and what
                                privacy controls are needed to be in place to

                                guide how a PIA is conducted. Trackon must look
                                at the design effectiveness, implementation, and
                                operating effectiveness of privacy

                                based on OPC guidance3, however, the Privacy
                                Officer may make modifications to the form on an
                                as-needed basis.

                                The PIA form should be completed in conjunction
                                with the Privacy Officer as it related to new

                                business model. Any staff managing initiatives
                                involving personal information must notify the
                                Privacy Officer that a PIA is required, and work
                                with the Privacy Officer to complete the PIA. In
                                order to avoid delays, sufficient time must be
                                allotted in project plans to allow for the
                                completion of a PIA, as well as any risk
                                mitigation implications deemed necessary. These
                                must be completed prior to the “go live” date of
                                new projects and/or processes.

                        grounds, Trackon must withhold it. Trackon may not

                        To send a CEM, Trackon needs express consent, either
                        orally or in writing. Written consent can be electronic.
                        Consent must be obtained prior to sending any
                        communication, excluding ones that are exempt under
                        regulations. Express consent cannot be obtained via a

                        ensures express consent requires a positive or explicit
                        indication of consent. A record of what type of
